        Community Aid is a community based mobile application that can be used by users to ask for assistance when needed. The targets audience of the application is individuals of all ages above 18. This is because the purpose of this application is to help individuals gain assistance when needed. My main personal inspiration for developing this application was a family member who is an elderly woman that has been stuck in her house during the time of Covid-19. I help her by doing her weekly shopping. After a few conversations with her I realized that it is exceedingly difficult for individuals in her position to receive help. Therfore, come on and help make the world a better place one assistance request at a time.

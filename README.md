# Community-Aid
Community Aid is a community-based mobile application allowing aid seekers to ask for assistance when needed and allowing volunteers to help aid seekers in a time of need. The inspiration for this project was the elderly who were stuck at home during the time of Covid-19. The main objective of community aid is to bring communities closer by assisting each other.
